##Descripción##

Traducción del proyecto original [Playground Project](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/PlaygroundProject)

A collection of simple scripts to create 2D physics game, intended for giving workshops to an audience of beginner game developers to quickly enable them to make games in Unity.

##Documentation

**Objective**

This project is intended to be as flexible as possible, not enforcing a specific game genre apart from the obvious constraints of being 2D and physics-powered. It contains a lot of scripts that perform _atomic_ tasks, that is they do mostly only one thing, so you can combine them to create _any kind_ of gameplay.

That said, the audience should already have an idea of how Unity works, the Editor interface, the concept of GameObjects, Components, the Scene View, Play Mode, and so forth. It might be useful to guide them through these concepts before letting them play with this project.

**Usage instructions**

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/PlaygroundProject/wiki) for instructions on how to use the framework.

**Software Requirements**

Required: Any Unity 5.x series

**Hardware Requirements**

Required: Laptop

**Owner and Responsible Devs**
